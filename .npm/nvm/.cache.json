Very simple setup and no need for a special shell.\n\n# Install\n\nYou do have to have at least one version of node and npm to get started, but after that you can install `nvm` with `npm`.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g nvm\n```\n\n# Setup\nYou must update your path to include ./node_modules/.bin\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH\n```\n\nNote, this is a good thing to do anyway â€“ it will allow you to run things like `jshint` on a per-repo basis without having to install it globally and without having to prefix the path.\n\n# Usage\n\n## nvm download <version>\nDownloads <version> from http://nodejs.org/dist/ and unpacks to ~/.nvm\n\n## nvm build <version>\nBuild a version of node.\n\n## nvm link <version>\nLink a version of `node` to the current app/library.\n\n## nvm unlink <version>\nUnlink a version of `node` to the current app/library.\n\n## nvm install <version>\nGlobally install a specific version of node.\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n\n```\nCopyright (c) 2013 Brian J.
